This course explores embodied interfaces, in which students learn to use TouchDesigner, MediaPipe, and other sensors to create real-time control systems where gestures and movements are the primary modes of interaction. Students will develop both technical skills and conceptual approaches to designing for embodied interaction, while exploring different ways computational systems can see, interpret, and respond to bodies in space through the lens of performance art, site-specific practices, and interface design.
