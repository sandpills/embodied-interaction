# Week 2: Drawing Machine
*Jan 26 — Screening Room*

## In Class
- Walking exercise
- William Forsythe Improvisation Technologies: [lines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X29OjcBHG8&list=PLAEBD630ACCB6AD45&index=1)
- Viewpoints: dimensions of variation
- How does a machine see? Brief computer vision history
- Technical workshop: media pipe + mapping values

## Assignment
- Watch: [Chunky Move, GLOW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AautwIOON8). As you watch, think about viewpoint's "composition", and notice moments when the body and the media seem in uniso, and moments when they seem at odds. Pick one moment of each and describe: What's happening technically? What's happening choreographically? Why does it feel unified or disjointed?
- Sketch: drawing machine V2. Iterate on your drawing machine, but this time, choose which body point is your "pen." Add variations to the pathway, and create a 30-second choreography with your machine.
