# Project 2: Duet

**Assigned:** Week 8
**Due:** Week 10 (Mar 30)

## Brief

Build an interface that requires two people. It should only "work" (produce the intended output) when both are present and engaged.

## Requirements

- The interface must require **two bodies** to function. 
- It should be clear when one person is missing or disengaged
- Consider the relationship between the two people: are they collaborating, competing, leading/following, calling/responding, or something else? Produce output that depends on that relationship.

## Questions to Consider

- What is the dynamic between the two people?
- Do they have the same role, or different?
- What happens when one person stops? Does the system break, pause, or change?
- Is there a goal, an arc, or is the interaction open-ended? 

## Deliverables

1. **In-class performance** (Week 10): 8 minute performance of your duet
2. **Documentation** (due week after crit):
   - Video documentation of your perforance
   - Written reflection
