# Project 1: Gestural Instrument

**Assigned:** Week 4
**Due:** Week 6 (Mar 2)

## Brief

Make a gestural audio-visual instrument with at least two sound parameters. The instrument should feel like it has *resistance*.

## Requirements

- Use MediaPipe for input
- At least two sound parameters controlled by hand or body movements
- Visual feedback that responds to your gestures
- The instrument should feel like it "pushes back": there should be a sense of physicality, effort, or constraint
- ONLY USE Touchdesigner for sound and visuals.

## What does "resistance" mean?

An instrument with resistance doesn't respond 1:1 to your input. Consider:
- **Inertia**: movement that continues after you stop
- **Friction**: effort required to change a parameter
- **Gravity**: values that fall or drift over time
- **Thresholds**: parameters that only activate past a certain point

## Deliverables

1. Gesture inventory sketch book (due Week 5)
2. In-class presentation (due Week 6): 3-5 minute performance of your instrument
3. Documentation (due Week 7):
	- Video of you demonstrating the instrument
	- Written reflection
