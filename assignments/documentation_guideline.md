## Hosting Your Documentation

You should set up a blog for your weekly assignment in this course.
- Google Site
	If you have taken an IMA foundational class and have a Google Site, you can use the same site to host your blog - just create a separate section / page for our class :)
- Notion
	Alternatively, Notion is a great platform to make a public blog/documentation page. Follow Notion site publishing guideline here
- Other Platforms
	Documentation hosted on other platforms or sites are welcome too! You can use Google Slides, Google Docs, Figma, Miro, GitHub Pages, ??? as long as you make it look nice and you can generate a link publicly available on the internet.

## Submission

You should submit a link to your blog posts through the [homework google form](https://forms.gle/kbiQE6qAnra35pxh8). The submission is due 11:59AM on Monday.

## Weekly Assignments

Each week, you're expected to submit a blog post. The content may include a sketch, a research report, a reading reflection, or a project development documentation. If you're submitting a project, you're also expected to submit a link to your .tox file in the form.

Below is what I expect from your post:

- for Sketch
    - A link to a google drive containing your .tox file (remember to share to public)
    - Written response: Describe your process with images. What was one technical challenge that was particularly fun or difficult, how did you approach or explore it?
- for Reading Reflection
    - Which Reading was it for
    - In your own sentences, what are 2-3 concepts or ideas that stood out to you?
    - Share one question or critique that emerged for you while reading. This could be something you'd like to discuss further in class, or an idea you'd like to challenge.

- Midterm and Final Project Documentation
	Gather and compile your performance materials into a documentation page, alongside your personal written reflection. Format could be creative, but the page should be accessible via a link on the internet. More guidelines coming soon.
