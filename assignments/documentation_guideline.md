## Hosting Your Documentation

You should set up a blog for your weekly assignments in this course.
- Google Site
	If you have taken an IMA foundational class and have a Google Site, you can use the same site to host your blog - just create a separate section / page for our class :)
- Notion
	Alternatively, Notion is a great platform to make a public blog/documentation page. Follow Notion site publishing guideline [here](https://www.notion.com/help/public-pages-and-web-publishing)
- Other Platforms
	Documentation hosted on other platforms or sites are welcome! You can use Google Slides, Google Docs, Figma, Miro, GitHub Pages, ??? as long as it looks organized, and you can generate a link publicly available on the internet.

## Submission

You should submit a link to your blog posts through the [homework google form](https://forms.gle/kbiQE6qAnra35pxh8) every week. The submission is due 11:59AM on Monday.

## Weekly Assignments

Each week, you're expected to submit a blog post. The content may include a sketch, a research report, a reading reflection, or a project development documentation. If you're submitting a project, you're also expected to submit your .tox file in the form, or a link to it in your blog.

Below is what I expect from your post:

- for Sketch
    - A link to your .tox file
    - Written response: Describe your process with images. What was one technical challenge that was particularly fun or difficult, how did you approach or explore it?
- for Reading Reflection
    - In your own sentences, what are some concepts or ideas that stood out to you?
    - Share one question or critique that emerged for you while reading. This could be something you'd like to discuss further in class, or an idea you'd like to challenge.

- Project Documentation
	Gather and compile your materials into a documentation page, alongside your personal written reflection. Format could be creative, but the page should be accessible via a link on the internet. More guidelines coming soon.
