Viola He: viola@nyu.edu

Office Hours by [appointment](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ23EM8KtHCIN9KOmjs7DCfXW8TV_BH-8c4p-lvPILKwtexd3Ib1yzEzuIOHw86tTN6UV1oFW2eQ)

## Course Description

In this course, students will develop both technical skills and conceptual approaches to designing for embodied interaction, while exploring different ways computational systems can see, interpret, and respond to bodies in space through the lens of performance art, site-specific practices, alternative game controls, and novel interface design

Students will learn to use TouchDesigner, MediaPipe, and other sensors to create real-time control systems where gestures and movements are the primary modes of interaction.

## Course Requirements

### Weekly assignments

Each week, you're expected to submit a short assignment in the form of either a sketch, a research report, or a reading reflection.

### Projects

There are a total of 3 projects, or longer-form production assignments, spanning 2-3 weeks. 
- Project 1 (solo): Build an instrument you play with your body. Perform your project.
- Project 2 (duet): Build an interface that requires two people. Consider the relationship between the two bodies, and an interface that only works when both people are engaged. Perform your project.
- Project 3 (group): An installation we design together as a class. Details tbd.

### Class Participation

Active engagement in class discussions, workshops, and collaborative sessions is essential. Students are expected to contribute thoughtfully. Come prepared to discuss, give feedback, and share work-in-progress. 

## Policies

### Attendance & Participation

This is a studio course, and your presence is expected. More than 2 unexcused absences will affect your participation grade. More than 4 will result in an F for the class. If you need to miss a class, arrive late, or leave early, email me or send a slack message beforehand. We're all adults, and I understand that unexpected things happen; you don't need to give me a reason, but you need to let me know BEFORE the class starts. Arriving more than 15 minutes late counts as half an absence.

### Use of Generative AI Tools 

All work submitted in this course (writing, code, etc) is expected to be your own. Outside contributions, whether machine-generated or from any conventional source, need to be properly cited and acknowledged. (See e.g. [this MLA guide](https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/) for how to cite ChatGPT) 

You’re welcome to explore AI tools to help generate ideas, brainstorm, or assist with learning. They might also help finding answers to technical questions (“Can you explain this code to me?”), but you must document your prompt, process, and AI’s response. Note that the tools we’re using in class are new, constantly evolving, and integrated with scripting languages in specific ways. Students should use their own discretion when learning with Generative AI tools.

Submitting materials you haven’t authored yourself unattributed will be considered a possible Academic Integrity violation.

### Instructional Technology

Email Communication: I will contact you via email or slack. You should check for emails from me (reminders, logistics, updates, etc.) at your NYU email address. Please note that I will try to respond to your emails within 24 hours. Do not expect immediate responses to emails sent late at night or on the weekends. 

Assignment Notification: All assignments will be posted to our course GitHub. You are responsible for looking at the website after each class period to learn about the next homework assignment.

Instructional Technology Tools and Assistance: If you need background on specific instructional technology tools, such as Zoom, NYU LMS (Brightspace) and Voicethread, check the [RITS Student Toolkit](https://wp.nyu.edu/shanghai-online_learning/). You may also email shanghai.rits@nyu.edu for assistance.

### Academic Honesty/Plagiarism

Carefully read NYU Shanghai’s Statement on Academic Integrity (in the [Undergraduate Bulletin](https://shanghai.nyu.edu/academics/curriculum/bulletin)).   Breaches of academic integrity could result in failure of an assignment, failure of the course, or other sanctions, as determined by the Academic Affairs office.

### Disability Disclosure Statement

NYU Shanghai is committed to providing equal educational opportunity and participation for students with disabilities. It is NYU Shanghai’s policy that no student with a qualified disability be excluded from participating in any NYU Shanghai program or activity, denied the benefits of any NYU Shanghai program or activity, or otherwise subjected to discrimination with regard to any NYU Shanghai program or activity. Any student who needs a reasonable accommodation based on a qualified disability should register with the [Moses Center for Student Accessibility](https://www.nyu.edu/students/communities-and-groups/student-accessibility.html) for assistance. Students can [register online](https://www.nyu.edu/students/communities-and-groups/student-accessibility/academic.html) through the Moses Center and can contact the Academic Accommodations Team at [shanghai.academicaccommodations@nyu.edu](mailto:shanghai.academicaccommodations@nyu.edu) with questions or for assistance.  

### Title IX Statement 

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title IX) prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in educational programs. It protects victims of sexual or gender-based bullying and harassment and survivors of gender-based violence. Protection from the discrimination on the basis of sex includes protection from being retaliated against for filing a complaint of discrimination or harassment. NYU Shanghai is committed to complying with Title IX and enforcing University policies prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex. Shakera Turi ([shakera.turi@nyu.edu](mailto:shakera.turi@nyu.edu)), Executive Director of the Office of Equal Opportunity, serves as the University’s Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator is a resource for any questions or concerns about sex discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual violence, or sexual misconduct and is available to discuss your rights and judicial options. University policies define prohibited conduct, provide informal and formal procedures for filing a complaint and a prompt and equitable resolution of complaints.
